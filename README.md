# Veterinary Practice SQL Database
Database created for a local veterinary practice to migrate their system from Excel to SQL, which is more flexible and accessible.

- The database accomodates all relevant data without loss of information.
- The database follows the principles of relational database design. In particular, all tables
are in third normal form. A comprehensive set of integrity and domain constraints have been applied:
  - Entity integrity
  - Referential integrity
  - Domain integrity

For this database, I initially created a simple Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to design its structure, which I then implemented with SQL.
# File information:
### Create.sql
- Creates the database and its tables. This includes their normalisation, constraints, and relevant integrity checks.

### Populate.sql
- Contains all the commands to insert the provided data into the tables.

### Queries.sql
- Contains queries to retreive specific information from the database. This includes joining tables together and subquerying.

# What I have learned from this course:
1. Map relational algebra constructs to implement SQL commands.  
2. Generate and test SQL code to define and manipulate relational data.  
3. Design appropriate and efficient database systems at the conceptual and logical level.  
4. Appraise and evaluate database performance improvement criteria.  
5. Describe, analyse and evaluate modern database trends.
